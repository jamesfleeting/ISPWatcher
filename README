ISPWatcher is a small python script that will watch various websites
services via the XML file email recipients if the service is down.

Create your ControlFile.xml by either copying the sample or following
the form of the sample file.

I recommend creating a cron job for every 15 minutes.

Cronjob Example:
#minute hour    mday    month   wday            command
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*/15    *       *       *       *       /home/gauthic/bin/ISPWatcher/ISPWatcher.py >> /home/gauthic/bin/ISPWatcher/ISPWatcher.log

Don't forget to chmod +x the ISPWatcher.py file if you use the above 
cronjob line, otherwise the script wont run.
