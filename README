ISPWatcher is a small python script that will watch various websites
services via the XML file email recipients if the service is down.

I recommend creating a cron job for every 15 minutes.

Cronjob Example:
#minute hour    mday    month   wday            command
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*/15    *       *       *       *       /home/gauthic/bin/ISPWatcher/ISPWatcher.py >> /home/gauthic/bin/ISPWatcher/ISPWatcher.log
